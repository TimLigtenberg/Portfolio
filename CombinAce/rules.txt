PREPARATION AND GAME EXPLANATION:

1. Each player gets a random number from 3 to 36, that’s your lucky number.
2. Each player gets 15 cards. The game contains two normal decks of cards.
3. One card is laid down and the game begins.
    The player who starts must lay down a card that has the same suit as the card or the same number/letter.
    If they can’t, they must draw a card. This can be laid down immediately if possible.
4. The next player does the same and so on.
5. In addition to a matching card, a player can also lay down a COMBINATION*.
6. The game is over when a player no longer has any cards and also does not have to draw any cards.
Further rules of cards are under the heading OTHER SPECIAL CARDS AND RULES.


COMBINATIONS*:

The combination may be more than 2 cards of the same number or letter of different suits, or more than 2 cards with consecutive numbers of the same suit.
The combination may only be laid down if the points of all cards added together correspond to your lucky number.

Jack, queen, and king count as 11 points. Ace counts as 1 or 12 points, you can decide for yourself.
Joker counts as extra/missing card.

Straight: ♦A + ♦2 + ♦3
3 of a kind: ♣10 + ♦10 + ♥10

USE OF ACE (Ace is 1 or 12) The Ace can always be used.
If the Ace is used in combinations, it does not have to match the combination.
To be able to use the Ace, the combination must already be correct and consist of at least 2 cards.
The Ace can be used to increase the total points of your combination by 1 or 12 to reach your lucky number.
There is no maximum on the number of Aces you can use in a combination.
♦2 + ♦3 + ♦4 + ♣A♦A♥A♠A = 10 or 21 points
♣5 + ♦5 + ♥5 + ♣A♦A♥A♠A = 16 or 27 points
♦2 + ♦3 + ♦4 + ♣A + ♦A = 11, 22 or 33 points
♦V + ♦K + ♦A + ♣A = 35 or 46 points

BUT if you use an Ace in a straight, it counts as 12 behind the King or as 1 before the 2
♣A + ♣2 + ♣3 = 6 points
♣K + ♣A + ♣2 + ♣3 = 17 points

USE OF THE JOKER (Joker is extra/missing card) The joker can always be used, also in combinations.
There may only be a maximum of 1 joker in a combination.
♦2 + JOKER + ♦4 = 9 points
♣10 + ♦10 + JOKER = 30 points


DRAWING CARDS:

If a combination has been thrown, the next player must draw cards unless they also lay down a combination.
If you have to draw, you throw the number of cards in the combination of normal dice to determine how many cards you have to draw.
If someone throws a straight with an Ace to get to their starting number (e.g. ♦2 + ♦3 + ♦4 + ♠A), the next player must throw 4 dice and draw the sum of them in cards.

If you throw an Ace or JOKER as a single card, the next player must draw cards.
With a 2 you skip drawing through jokers and Aces, so you go on to the next but no extra cards are added.
An Ace, a 2 and a joker may always be thrown one after the other until a player no longer lays down a card.
This player must draw cards. The person who has to draw, draws 3 cards per laid Ace and joker.
If 2s have been laid, these are not added.

If there are no more cards on the draw pile, the laid cards may be shuffled and made into a new draw pile. Only the last laid card must remain

OTHER SPECIAL CARDS AND RULES:

- WITH UNO (when you have exactly the same card in your hand as a card that is thrown, you may lay it down immediately and the game continues to the person who is next in turn)
- You don't have to say it when you only have one card left.
- If you play a 7, it’s your turn again
- If you play an 8, the next player must skip a turn
- If you play a JACK, you can choose what type of card it becomes
- If you play a KING, the game continues in the opposite direction
